This program was developed to solve the problem of molecular dynamics about the time evolution of a three-dimensional system of
moving particles on GPU. 

definition of variables:
n - number of particles along x and y directions of initial lattice
nz - number of particles along z and y directions of initial lattice
iter - number of time steps
dt - value of the time step
Lx - linear size of the system along x direction
p0 - maximum value of initial impulse module of particles
epsilon, sigma - parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential
kin_E - kinetic energy
pot_E - potential energy
total_E - total energy
T - temperature
kb - Boltzmann coefficient
R - mean square deviation
V - autocorrelation function
